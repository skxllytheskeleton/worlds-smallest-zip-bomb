# World's Smallest Zip Bomb
At 17.8mb, this zip bomb contains a payload of 0b. Ending in annoyance.txt, at 0 bytes, this zip bomb is absolutely useless.
Similarly to p.zip, this zip bomb is 26 layers, of 26 zip files. It's 27 layers if you include the top layer containing it all (minor inconvenience.zip)
I believe this zip bomb to be the world's smallest, considering it is 0 bytes.
Since it's the smallest, I only named it minor inconvenience.
